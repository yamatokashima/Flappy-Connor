E.g. once participant may have had the need to go to the bathroom102	exp	1	1	26	1	lang&comm	7	moving	How is temporal information processed when one revisits the past or anticipates the future?	"Explicitly Also, very broad ( the question doesn't include the aspect of motion that is brought forward in the hypothesis)"		It provides more insight into the connections between mental processes and physical behavior	small number of participants closed laboratory environment not very precise103	exp	1	1	28	1	ciw	12	moving	How is temporal information processed when one revisits the past or anticipates the future?	"think back in time ->backward movement, prospective thought -> forward movement"			104	exp	1	1	24	1	eng lit and ling	5	moving	How is temporal information processed when one revisits the past or anticipates the future?	"question: see 1, answer: mental time travel has an observable behavioral correlate - the direction of people's movements through space (i.e. retrospective thought = backward movement)"		this can be used for lie-detectors to see if someone tells the truth. Backward movements could indicate a true memory.	The method groups is very small (20 participants) and very young (18-24)105	exp	1	1	24	2	english lang & cult	6	moving	How is temporal information processed when one revisits the past or anticipates the future?	The question was presented after a brief elaboration on the terms that are relevant for this study.	the answer was that mental time travel has an observable behavioral correlate. Chronesthesia appears to be grounded in the perception-action systems that support social-cognitive functioning.	This study demonstrates that the embodiment of time and space yields an overt behavioral marker on otherwise invisible mental operation.	The groups of participants was relatively small. This study does not show if sex had any influence on chronesthesia. The age of the participants was relatively young.106	exp	1	1	20	1	lang & comm	5	moving	How is temporal information processed when one revisits the past or anticipates the future?	Do people sway forward or backward when they time travel (mentally)?	answer = yes	It saw something about what happens in your brain when you travel subjectively through time -> time travelling is grounded in the perception action systems that support social-cognitive functioning.	"It might not have been precise enough. They didn't measure the magnitude of the sway in relation to the temporal distance. Also, they didn't vary the sequential ordering, or evocativeness of chronesthetic episodes, which may influence peoples movements."
